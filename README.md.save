# Traffic Reduction Analysis Project

This project analyzes traffic data from multiple intersections to identify congestion patterns and propose traffic reduction strategies. The analysis is performed entirely using SQL Server.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to reduce traffic congestion by analyzing vehicle counts, average speeds, and congestion scores at various intersections. This helps city planners and traffic engineers make data-driven decisions.

## How to Run the SQL Script

1. Install **SQL Server** (or use a Docker container with SQL Server).
2. Open **Azure Data Studio** and connect to your SQL Server instance.
3. Open the `TrafficReductionProject.sql` script in Azure Data Studio.
4. Execute the script line by line or run all at once to create the database, tables, views, and stored procedures.
5. Check the output queries and views for daily traffic summaries and congestion scores.

## Sample Outputs / Screenshots

Below are some example outputs from the project:

1. **Daily Traffic Summary**

2. **Intersection Congestion Scores**

## Technologies Used

- SQL Server (2019)
- Azure Data Studio
- Docker (optional, for SQL Server container)
- Git & GitHub (version control)
